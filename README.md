#New York Park Event's
--------------------------------------
**Project Purpose**: This application will display event's happening in different parks within New York state according to the National Parks Service API. Additionally, it will allow you to search for parks in any state using their two letter abbreviation. The search will display six parks.

**Project Link:** [newyorkparks](newyorkparks.surge.sh)

**Built with:** 

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript - The data presented in the event's section as well as the data presented in the parks section after the user searches a state using the respective two letter code.

**API's In Use:** 

* National Park Service


**Features:**

* Event's currently happening in different New York parks.
* Gives user the ability to search for parks in any state. It provides the user with six parks with links to each parks page.

**Stretch Goals:**

* The app currently forces the api to give it four images for each park even if they only have three. I need to use javascript to prevent that from happening.
* I need to add animation to the event's section so that the 'next event' functionality performs more smoothly.
